# HW3-Password-Generator
Homework #3, javascript Password Generator

This project is to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The user should have the option to apply upper case alpha, lower case alpha, numbers, and special characters in the password with a length between 8 and 128 characters. 

The user begins by clicking on an identified button and will then select each criteria option through confirms and finally the password length via a prompt.
